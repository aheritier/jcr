<para>The main purpose of content repository is to maintain the data.
    The heart of content repository is the data model:
  </para>

  <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The main data storage abstraction of JCR's data model is a
          workspace.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Each repository should have one or more workspaces.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The content is stored in a workspace as a hierarchy of
          items.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Each workspace has its own hierarchy of items.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Node is intended to support the data hierarchy. It is of type
    using namespaced names which allow the content to be structured in
    accordance with standardized constraints. A node may be versioned
    through an associated version graph (optional feature)
  </para>

  <para>Property stored data are values of predefined types (String,
    Binary, Long, Boolean, Double, Date, Reference, Path).
  </para>

  <para>It is important to note that the data model for the interface (the
    repository model) is rarely the same as the data models used by the
    repository's underlying storage subsystems. The repository knows how to
    make the client's changes persistent because that is part of the
    repository configuration, rather than part of the application
    programming task.

    <para>
      Java Content Repository API as well as other Java language related standards is created within the Java Community Process (http://jcp.org/) as a result of collaboration of an expert group and the Java community. It is known as <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR-170</ulink> (Java Specification Request).

</para>
    
    <para>How do you know the data of your website are stored? The images are
    probably in a file system, the meta data are in some dedicated files -
    maybe in XML - the text documents and PDFs are stored in different folders
    with the meta data in an other place (a database?) and in a proprietary
    structure. How do you manage to update these data and how do you manage
    the access rights? If your boss asks you to manage different versions of
    each document or not? The larger your website is, the more you need a
    <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Content
    Management Systems</ulink> (CMS) which tackles all these issues.</para> 

    <para>These CMS solutions are sold by different vendors and each vendor
    provides its own API for interfacing the proprietary content repository.
    The developers have to deal with this and need to learn the
    vendor-specific API. If in the future you wish to switch to a different
    vendor, everything will be different and you will have a new
    implementation, a new interface, etc.</para>

    <para>JCR provides a unique java interface for interacting with both text
    and binary data, for dealing with any kind and amount of meta data your
    documents might have. JCR supplies methods for storing, updating, deleting
    and retrieving your data, independent of the fact if this data is stored
    in a RDBMS, in a file system or as an XML document - you just don't need
    to care about. The JCR interface is also defined as classes and methods
    for searching, versioning, access control, locking, and
    observation.</para>

    <para>Furthermore, an export and import functionality is specified so that
    a switch to a different vendor is always possible.</para>

      <emphasis role="bold">What does eXo do?</emphasis>
  </citetitle> 
</para>

    <para>eXo fully complies a JCR standard <ulink url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR 170</ulink>; therefore with
    eXo JCR you can use a vendor-independent API. It means that you could switch any time to a different vendor. Using the standard lowers your 
    lifecycle cost and reduces your long term risk.</para>

    <para>Of course eXo does not only offer JCR, but also the complete
    solution for ECM (Enterprise Content Management) and for WCM (Web Content
    Management).</para>

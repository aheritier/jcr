/**
 * Test that proves BufferedJBossCache as a solution against dead-locks.
 * Was tested with lockAcquisitionTimeout="10000" (10s).
 * If ordering is not done in BufferedJBossCache then this test shown TimeOutException
 * when one thread waits for another one. Like this:
 * 
 * org.jboss.cache.lock.TimeoutException: Unable to acquire lock on Fqn [/$CHILD_NODES_LIST/2235b1da7f0000014f62cf6a381e342f]
 *     after [10000] milliseconds for requestor [GlobalTransaction:<null>:243]! Lock held by [GlobalTransaction:<null>:244]
 * org.jboss.cache.lock.TimeoutException: Unable to acquire lock on Fqn [/$CHILD_NODES_LIST/2235b1d67f0000017209d9af66cfae9a] 
 *     after [10000] milliseconds for requestor [GlobalTransaction:<null>:244]! Lock held by [GlobalTransaction:<null>:243]
 *     
 * When running this test you should manually check that this is really a dead-lock when the first thread is waiting for 
 * the second and the second for the first one. (like example when TX243 waits TX244 and contrary)
